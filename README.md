# Jello

Jello is a christmas project that grew arms & legs.
I really dig the Apple Music app, so I decided to build a clone that streams music from your Jellyfin server.

At the moment the app is functionally quite simple. The objective is to progressively build it to parallel the feature set and aesthetic appeal of Apple Music.

This is a work in progress and I've only tested this on my own network. There will be bugs...please submit an issue or raise a PR :)

## Getting Started

Jello is available on [TestFlight](https://testflight.apple.com/join/VdrBFmbL)
